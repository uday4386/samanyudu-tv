# 🔊 How to Install Female Telugu Voice (Microsoft Kalpana)

Websites cannot "install" voices inside the page. They use the voices already installed on your Windows computer. If you only hear a Male voice, it means the Female voice is missing from your Windows settings.

**Follow these simple steps to install it for free:**

### Step 1: Open Windows Settings
1. Press `Windows Key` + `I` to open Settings.
2. Go to **Time & Language** -> **Language & Region** (or just "Speech" in Windows 10).

### Step 2: Add Telugu Language Pack
1. Click **"Add a language"**.
2. Search for **"Telugu"**.
3. Select **"Telugu (India)"** and click Next.
4. **IMPORTANT:** Check the box for **"Text-to-speech"**. (This is the voice!).
5. Click **Install**.

### Step 3: Verify Voice Install
1. Once installed, go to **Time & Language** -> **Speech**.
2. Under "Voices", you should now see **"Microsoft Kalpana"** (this is the Female voice) and "Microsoft Hemant".

### Step 4: Restart Browser
1. **Close your web browser completely** (Chrome, Edge, etc.).
2. Re-open it and go back to your Samanyudu TV app.
3. Select "Female" in the Manage News tab.
4. It should now speak with the Female (Kalpana) voice!
